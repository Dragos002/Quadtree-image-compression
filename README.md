# Quadtree-image-compression
 I took the matrix given in the input file, and to build the tree, I created a recursive function that divides the matrix into 4 zones, using the "check" function to verify if the "square" can be further divided or if a leaf node can be created from it. After the tree was created, I performed a traversal to number the nodes sequentially, aiding in adding nodes to the vector while considering the vector index of each node's children in the specified order.
Through another recursive function that creates a quadtree from the vector read from the compression file checks if the elements in the vector are leaf nodes for the tree, and if not, it goes recursively through all the children of the created node. After obtaining the tree, considering the size of each node (given by its depth), I filled in the requested matrix.
Mostly using the same functions explained above, with two additional functions that helped modify the tree based on the rules deduced from the images present in the assignment statement.
